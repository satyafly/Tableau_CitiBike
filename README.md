# Tableau_CitiBike
Which Bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection this year? 

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever, you must also:**

* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence. 

## Considerations

Remember, the people reading your analysis will NOT be data analysts. Your audience will be city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City departments. Your data and analysis needs to be presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling. Your visualizations should be colorful enough to be included in press releases, and your analysis should be thoughtful enough for dictating programmatic changes. 

## Assessment

Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics: 

* Completeness of Analysis 

* Analytic Rigor

* Readability

* Visual Attraction

* Professionalism
